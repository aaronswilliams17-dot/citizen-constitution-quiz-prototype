Rapid product prototype for a nonpartisan civic education app using source-locked, simulated AI logic.
# Citizen Constitution – Quiz Prototype

A rapid product prototype for a nonpartisan civic education app designed to help users understand the U.S. Constitution through short, daily quizzes with source-based explanations.

This project was created as a time-boxed product exercise to demonstrate problem-solving, communication, and ethical AI design under tight timelines.

## 🔍 Problem

Many people want to better understand the U.S. Constitution and how it functions in practice, but existing resources are often:
- overly technical,
- politically framed,
- or difficult to engage with consistently.

This creates a barrier to informed civic participation.

---

## 💡 Solution

A lightweight web-based app concept that:
- delivers short daily quizzes,
- explains answers in plain language,
- cites official, nonpartisan source material,
- and reinforces learning through repetition.

This prototype focuses on **clarity, integrity, and user trust** rather than feature completeness.

---

## ⚖️ Design Constraints & Principles

- **Nonpartisan by design**  
  No political opinions or speculative interpretations.

- **Source-locked content**  
  Explanations are based only on official documents such as:
  - the U.S. Constitution
  - Supreme Court constitutional rulings
  - other verified government sources

- **Explainability first**  
  Every answer includes a clear explanation and a source reference.

- **Accuracy over automation**  
  Speed and scale are secondary to correctness and trust.

## ⏱ Rapid Build Timeline

This prototype was intentionally scoped and built quickly to simulate real-world product constraints.

**Day 1**
- Defined user problem and constraints
- Outlined MVP feature set
- Identified non-goals

**Day 2**
- Built quiz flow and explanation logic
- Implemented simulated AI behavior
- Structured source-based content

**Day 3**
- Refined scope
- Documented decisions and trade-offs
- Prepared prototype for review

## 🤖 About the “AI” in This Prototype

This prototype uses **simulated AI logic** rather than a live generative model.

The system:
- selects questions from a predefined source set,
- presents explanations tied directly to those sources,
- and mimics daily quiz behavior.

This approach was chosen intentionally to:
- avoid hallucinations,
- maintain transparency,
- and clearly demonstrate system rules and constraints.

A real AI model could be integrated later within these same boundaries.

---

## 🚫 Explicit Non-Goals

The following were intentionally excluded from the prototype:
- user accounts or authentication
- personalization or data tracking
- real-time AI API integration
- mobile platform builds
- political analysis or opinion content

These decisions were made to prioritize correctness, clarity, and speed.

---

## 🔮 Next Steps (If Expanded)

With additional time and validation, future iterations could include:
- difficulty levels
- topic-based progress tracking
- printable study materials
- accessibility improvements
- offline learning packs

---

## 🧠 What This Prototype Demonstrates

- Rapid problem framing
- Clear communication of technical concepts
- Ethical and constrained AI design
- Product judgment under time pressure
- Focus on integrity and quality assurance


## Use of AI Tools

AI tools were used as a development accelerator for scaffolding, code generation, and iteration.

All product decisions, system constraints, architecture choices, and content rules were defined, reviewed, and validated by me. AI was treated as an assistive tool, not a decision-maker.
